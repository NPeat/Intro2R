**Intro to R (Rfun)** is from *R We Having Fun Yetâ€½*, or [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/), a learning series hosted by the [Center for Data & Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/data/). At the main Rfun page we host learning modules with shareable code, video recordings of workshops, YouTube video modules, slide decks, and data sets. Our goals is for you to become more fluent in R as you analyze data.\

This page host the quickStart materials to get started with R. We use these reources in our three-part introduction to R. Beyond getting started quickly, the next-level of materials and intermediate materials can all be found at [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu), where you will also find additional links to the Rfun [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/johnlittle1) channel and [GitHub](https://github.com/libjohn) code.
