**Intro to R (Rfun)** is from *R We Having Fun Yetâ€½*, or [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/), a learning series hosted by the [Center for Data & Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/data/). At the main Rfun page we host learning modules with shareable code, video recordings of workshops, YouTube video modules, slide decks, and data sets. Our goals is for you to become more fluent in R as you analyze data.\
\
A highlight of our introductory series are the Rfun quickStart materials you need to get started with data science and R. We offer a three-part introduction to R with shareable learning resources. Beyond getting started quickly, the next-level of materials and intermediate materials are then found at [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu). You will also find links to additional resources like the Rfun [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/johnlittle1) channel and [GitHub](https://github.com/libjohn) code.
