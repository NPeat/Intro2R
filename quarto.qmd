After installing R, RStudio, and the Tidyverse packages, you're ready to send commands to the R-interpreter.

## Console

A very simple way to code is to send commands directly to the *console* (bottom-left quadrant in RStudio). For example, type: *cars ---* then hit the enter key.

This approach is convenient but not very [reproducible](proj.html#reproducibility).

## Notebooks - RECOMENDED

I recommend using Quarto Documents. This provides a visual notebook where coders blend code with prose, then render publishable documents from the quarto-document. Another option are R Markdown documents; R Markdown is the predecessor to Quarto.

:::

The basic steps are

1.  Begin new Quarto document (`File > New file > Quarto document`)
2.  Compose explanation of goals and code-chunks using *natural language* (i.e. prose)
3.  Add code-chunks (`Ctrl-Alt-i`) to compose code. (intersperse code-chunks with prose)
4.  Render document into a publishable report[^1]

[^1]: Many report formats are available including: PDF, MS Word, Slides, PPTX, HTML, EPUB, Web sites, Blogs, Interactive interfaces.

## Scripts - plain vanilla

You can also code the old fashion way using a plain vanilla .R script.[^2]
