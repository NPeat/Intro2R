The following learning materials support our *Introduction to R: Data Transformations, Analysis, and Data Structures* workshop.  Hosted by [Data & Visualization Services](http://library.duke.edu/) at Duke University Libraries, this is the first part of a multi-part learning series on R that we call [*R We Having Fun Yetâ€½*](https://rfun.library.duke.edu).  

This gentle introduction provides a hands-on experience to learn the basics of modern R using RStudio and the Tidyverse method.  Learn about managing your R projects, data types, variable assignments, data structures, and visualization packages such as `ggplot2` and `mapview`.  The focus of these learning resources is as a code demonstrations supporting our in-person workshop.  Thus the explanatory prose is minimal, but you can watch an earlier recording below.  If you wish to read more about R, we recommend [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [Data Visualization for Social Science](http://socviz.co/).  Interactive primers and courses are available.  Try the [Rstudio Cloud primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), or register for workshops at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).
